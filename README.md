# Code-Quiz

**Description**

This is a quiz application using HTML, CSS, and Javascript. This application emphasizes the use of Javascript to provide quiz questions and collect user data to determine whether the answers to a question are correct. This then generates a score and appends a final page of results from the user data.

This project has been deployed to GitHub Pages. To get this project up and running, you can follow the deployment link.

After clicking "Start Quiz", the user is prompted to complete a 5 question quiz within the 60 second time limit. A wrong answer causes 10 seconds to be deducted, while a correct answer will add an additional 10 seconds to the timer. The user is then able to submit their score, which gets stored to the high scores list.
