# Code-Quiz

**Description**

This is a quiz application using HTML, CSS, and Javascript. This application emphasizes the use of Javascript to provide quiz questions and collect user data to determine whether the answers to a question are correct. This then generates a score and appends a final page of results from the user data.

This project has been deployed to GitHub Pages. To get this project up and running, the user can follow the deployment link.

**Usage**

* After clicking "Start Quiz", the user is prompted to complete a 5 question quiz within the 75 second time limit. 
* A wrong answer causes 10 seconds to be deducted from the timer. 
* If the user completes all questions or if the timer runs out, the user will be alerted to their final score and taken to an end of quiz screen.
* The user is then able to enter their initials to submit their score, which gets stored to the high scores list.
* At the top left corner, users can click to view the score leaderboard.
